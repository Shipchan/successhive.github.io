Know Thy Choice or KTC provides students a comprehensive and personalized project experience, and we leave no stone unturned to fulfill the needs of a student. Our offerings are backed by our ‘No Questions Asked, 100% money-back guarantee’.

### Details of the guarantee: 
Students can cancel any time before beginning the program or within the first 3 sessions of commencing the program to get a 100% refund. This can be done by writing an email to shipra@knowthychoice.in or calling us on +91 6268788090.

No refunds can be made after the above mentioned timelines or in the middle of the program.
 
In the case of class cancellation in the middle of the course by KTC, we will arrange an alternate batch/class to complete the course.
 
If enrollment in a class does not reach a minimum threshold, we may contact you to reschedule to another batch, in order to achieve a superior learning experience and group engagement.

1. 100% refund, if the rescheduled dates do not fit into the student’s schedule.
2. Please note that rescheduling will be subject to the availability of seats.
 
For any refunds, KTC will take 3 business days.
