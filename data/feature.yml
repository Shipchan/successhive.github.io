Title3rd: Career Counselling
description3rd: Even though most careers start post school, most of the career decisions are often made during the school period. We believe career guidance is a basic need and we have brought together some of the top couseling professionals to guide kids with their career choices. And this happens not in isolated encounters, but at regular intervals, in an iterative way, throughout the course of the kid's high school years.
