  - question: Why should my child enrol for KTC Career Exploration Program?
    answer: We love test drives and free samples. Helps us choose the right product, isn't it? When the ice-cream place lets you sample multiple flavors before choosing one, it's only fair our kids get to make conscious choices about their futures too, no? The world is changing rapidly and it's our responsibility to send our kids out prepared. At KTC, our misssion is to 'not have any more blue Mondays' for our kids. We help kids dabble with multiple career streams in a hands-on fashion, with actual industry experts, real-life internships and real-life challenges. This not ony helps them decide which career to pick, but also prepares them for their dream careers. After all, we are only as good as our next choice.
